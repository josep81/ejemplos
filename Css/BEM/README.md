# BEM

BEM is a simple naming convention that makes your frontend code easier to read.

## Usage

To use BEM, we only need to follow its naming convention.

- The B stands for block.
- The E stands for element. An element is a part of a block.
- The M stands for modifier.

### Blocks

* In the BEM methodology, blocks only have a class name.
* Example: `.card`

### Elements

* The elements of a block are prefixed with the block name joined by double underscores.
* Example: `.card__button`

### Modifiers

* Modifiers are prefixed with the block name or element that they modify joined by hyphen.
* Examples: `.card__button-accept` `.card__button-decline` `.card-info` `card-current`
